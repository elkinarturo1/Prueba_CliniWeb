				The HTML above contains lists of teams with the employees on each team.  The first team is "Sales" and the second team is "Marketing".  
				
				Sales team:
				John Smith, Manager
				Joe Gibbens, Salesman 1
				Charles Barkley, Salesman 2
				
				Marketing team:
				Pepe Lopez, Manager
				Joey Jones, Marketer 1
				Kenny Smith, Marketer 2
				
				Write a function below that returns the employee's name when passing in the team and employee title.  For example, employeeSearch('Sales', 'Manager') would return 'John Smith'.
				Things to consider:
				1) Make sure your code is reasonbly efficient
				2) Make sure your code is easy to understand so another developer can maintain it
				3) The method should not cause an error if someone passes in an employee that doesn't exist.  For example, employeeSearch('Sales', 'Intern')
				4) You can modify the HTML when doing this exercise to make it work with your function.
				5) You need to get all needed information from HTML, you cannot solve this just by having all employee's data in a javascript variable.

			function employeeSearch(team, employee) {
				// Implement the function here.
